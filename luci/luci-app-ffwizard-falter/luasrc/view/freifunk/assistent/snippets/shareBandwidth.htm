    <%= translate("The nodes of the Freifunk network forward data based on shortest paths and highest \
    bandwidth. Therefore we need to know, how much bandwidth to the internet there is and how much do \
    you want to share. Typical values are 6.0 Mbit/s download and 0.5 Mbit/s upload with \
    <em>DSL 6000</em> or 50.0 Mbit/s download and 10.0 Mbit/s upload with <em>VDSL 50000</em>. \
    Preferably you test the actual bandwidth multiple times with a tool like <em>speedof.me</em>. Then \
    you can fill in how much bandwidth you are willing to share with your peers. Please be generous, \
    but don't overestimate. :-)") %>
