"<br> <p>This site gives you the chance to define your own services for the "
"Freifunk network. If you enter the service details here, they will get "
"announced to the mesh and other Freifunkers can use them. It's quite similar "
"to regular web services, except this ones only live in Freifunk network. But "
"there are other ways to get your service exposed to the internet. Just ask "
"us, if you are interested in that.</p> <p>You can find two tabs in this app: "
"<b>Websites</b> and <b>Generic Services</b>. They differ in what you want to "
"do and how much you are experienced.</p> <p><b>Websites</b> will configure "
"you a (static) website on your router. It will not only announce it to the "
"mesh, but will additionally set up OpenWrts <i>uhttpd</i>-webserver, to "
"serve your site. Please mind: As by the limitations of <i>uhttpd</i>, every "
"Website must have it's own port. Especially you cannot use port 80, unless "
"you deactivate the LuCI web-ui, which uses that port per default.</p> <p>The "
"<b>Generic Services</b> gives you more flexibility in that way, that you can "
"configure services that run on some other host in your local Freifunk net. "
"If you are going to expose a webcam or some kind of server, this option is "
"the right one for you.</p><br>"
