# Contributing to Falter
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use GitHub, So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, test it and describe your tests in the PR.
3. Make sure your code lints (it has correct syntax).
4. Make sure that every commit in your PR matches the formal requirements (see below).
5. Issue that pull request!

### Requirements on commits
Please make sure, that every commit you make to this repository meets this requirements. They get checked by our CI:

```txt
$PACKAGE_NAME: one-line-description of your changes

More detailed description of your changes. This part might be
as long and detailed as you wish.

Signed-off-by: $YOUR_SIGNATURE
```
You can add the signed-off-by line automatically via `git commit -s`. 

## Any contributions you make will be under the GPLv3 Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GPLv3 License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/freifunk-berlin/falter-packages/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/freifunk-berlin/falter-packages/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
A good bug report helps the maintainers a lot to understand you problem and fix it faster.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
As the code in this repository originates from several sources, some reaching back up to 2005 or so, we aren't too strict on coding style:

1. Use spaces instead of tabs, please.
2. keep consistent within your contribution or the package.

## License
