# How to have a release

Releases are build with our [instance of buildbot](https://buildbot.berlin.freifunk.net/).

1. Log in using your GitHub account.
2. Select [Builds/Builders](https://buildbot.berlin.freifunk.net/#/builders)
3. Select `builds/packages` or `builds/targets` depending on what you want to do.
4. On the top right corner you can find buttons to start the corresponding actions.

## Beta Testing
We always do a public pre-release for beta-testing within the community. When selecting the `Build Release`-Button simply name the falter release version accordingly e.g. `1.2.3-rc1` where `rc` stands for release candidate.
