# These two files are added by the olsrd package,

# Their presents somehow results in an additional olsrd process
# being spawned, but with the bad incomplete olsrd6 config,
# which results in repeating logread entries:
#
#     daemon.err olsrd[123]: olsrd exit: main: Bad configuration
#
# Let's just remove them manually to get rid of the log spam.
